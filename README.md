# Motion-Control-with-NN
This project presents the implementation of a two-layer neural network for motion control of a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic manipulator, specifically the Puma 560, a manipulator already available in Peter Corke’s Robotics Toolbox. The project was developed using Simulink in combination with Peter Corke’s Robotics Toolbox.
